# This file contains Vagrant and VirtualBox configuration.

# Settings in this file are project specific, not a local machine specific. 
#
# If there is a need to override any value, create file settings.local.yml
# and put it there. Local settings should not be committed to the repository.

# Vagrant configuration.
vagrant:
  # Box to use. At the moment Debian-based distributions are supported only.
  # Do not change this value, unless absolutely necessary. Valid use case is
  # 32-bit host machine and no support for virtualization of 64-bit guest
  # machine.
  # Default to "Official Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)".
  # Change this parameter in the local settings file.
  box: "ubuntu/trusty64"
  # Box version.
  box_version: "14.04"
  # Host name. This setting is required. Usually host name matches project name.
  hostname: ""

# VirtualBox configuration.
#
# Virtual machine specification is quite machine-specific. This file provides
# default settings that should work just fine for a common 2015-2016 machine:
#   - quad core CPU
#   - hardware virtualization support
#   - 8+Gb of RAM
#   - SSD
#
# Sometimes VirtualBox will fail to start with provided settings. For example:
#   - single core CPU
#   - no hardware virtualization support
#   - low amount of RAM
#
# In that case virtual machine specification must be overridden. Do not edit
# this file directly. This file contains global poroject-wide settings, i.e.
# these settings are shared between all project members. Local settings file is
# the right place to do it.
virtualbox:
  # Machine name. Optional, defaults to Vagrant host name.
  name: ""
  # Number of CPUs. Lower this value if host machine has single/dual core CPU
  # and/or no hardware virtualization support.
  cpus: 2
  # Memory limit (in MB). Small projects may work with less amount of RAM
  # available. However, machine provisioning usually requires more memory than
  # normal run. If the host machine has limited RAM available, lower memory
  # limit after virtual machine provisioning.
  memory: 1024
  # CPU execution cap (in %). Lower this value if host machine has single core
  # CPU.
  cpuexecutioncap: 100
